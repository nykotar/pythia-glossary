name: Gestalt (Remote Viewing)
aliases: []
definition: |
  In remote viewing, a gestalt refers to the fundamental, overarching concept or essence of a target. It captures the primary qualities or "overall nature" of the site, such as land, water, or manmade elements, and serves as a foundational layer of perception. Derived from psychology, the term "gestalt" conveys the idea of a unified whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. Remote viewing sessions often begin by identifying these basic gestalts, which are then explored in detail to uncover the target's unique attributes, such as textures, dimensions, or emotional impressions. By focusing on gestalts, remote viewers build a clear, structured understanding of the target in an unbiased and systematic way.
