definition: |
  Controlled Remote Viewing (CRV) is a structured methodology developed to teach and refine remote viewing, enabling individuals to access and report subconscious knowledge with precision. Originating from experiments conducted at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in the 1970s and 1980s, CRV was created by Ingo Swann and Dr. Harold E. Puthoff to make remote viewing teachable and to reduce interference or "noise" from imagination, emotions, and other contaminants. It involves a systematic process of sketching and recording data across six progressive stages, each deepening the viewer's connection to the target. Initially termed "Coordinate Remote Viewing" due to its use of geographic coordinates, the name was later changed to "Controlled Remote Viewing" to reflect its broader applications. Over time, CRV has evolved into various adaptations, including TRV, SRV, and others, often tailored to individual teaching styles and methodologies.
