name: Analytical Overlay
aliases:
  - AOL
  - STRAY CAT
definition: |
  A phenomenon in remote viewing where the viewer's conscious or unconscious mind generates interpretations or guesses based on partial or emerging data, often influenced by preconceptions or logical analysis. These interpretations, which can manifest as vivid mental images or comparisons (e.g., "it looks like..."), are typically inaccurate but may contain elements related to the target. For example, a viewer perceiving a large, flat area surrounded by movement might describe it as an "airport runway," when the target is actually a frozen lake with people skating on it. To maintain session integrity, viewers are trained to identify and declare AOLs immediately, labeling them to "purge" the noise and refocus on the true signal line. By doing so, they minimize the influence of these overlays.
