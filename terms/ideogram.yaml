name: Ideogram (Remote Viewing)
aliases: []
definition: |
  An ideogram is a spontaneous, reflexive graphic mark created during remote viewing to represent a basic concept or "gestalt" of the target. It is produced through the viewer's subconscious response to the target's signal, transmitted via the autonomic nervous system to the hand and pen. This mark serves as a bridge between subconscious perception and conscious interpretation. Each ideogram is simple, swift, and uniquely tied to a singular aspect of the target, forming the foundation for deeper exploration and description within the remote viewing process.
