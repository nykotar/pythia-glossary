# Pythia Glossary
The Pythia Glossary is a comprehensive resource for remote viewing terminology, specifically created for use with the Pythia bot in the [r/remoteviewing Discord server](https://discord.gg/remoteviewing). This project is a collaborative effort, welcoming contributions from everyone interested in refining existing entries or adding new terms.
  
## Motivation
Remote viewing often involves specialized terminology that can be confusing, especially for beginners. Without a centralized resource, people rely on varied explanations, leading to potential misunderstandings. The Pythia Glossary aims to offer a consistent source of definitions to support the community.
